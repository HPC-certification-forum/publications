\textit{%
The HPC community has always considered the training of new and existing HPC practitioners to be of high importance to its growth. The significance of training will increase even further in the era of Exascale when HPC encompasses even more scientific disciplines. This diversification of HPC practitioners challenges the traditional training approaches, which are not able to satisfy the specific needs of users, often coming from non-traditionally HPC disciplines and only interested in learning a particular set of skills. HPC centres are struggling to identify and overcome the gaps in users’ knowledge. How should we support prospective and existing users who are not aware of their own knowledge gaps?
}

\medskip

\textit{%
We started the establishment of the International HPC Certification program that aims to clearly categorize, define and examine HPC related skills.
Oriented on the needs of practitioners, the program does not define a linear curriculum or interfere with content providers.
Ultimately, we aim for the certificates to be recognized and respected by the HPC community and industry.

\end{multicols}
}


\headerbox{Competences and Skills}{name=box12,column=0,below=abstract, span=2}{
Various competencies are necessary to efficiently use HPC resources.
A skill is a meaningful competence that comes with a \textbf{clear definition} of knowledge/practical ability, \textbf{levels of knowledge}, \textbf{relations to other skills}.
An excerpt of the first levels of the skill-tree:

\headerbox{Get Involved!}{name=box2,column=1,below=box12,above=bottom}{
This is an independent community-wide effort.

\bigskip

\textbf{Who can join?}

%\begin{itemize}
%\item
Anyone (person or organization) experienced or interested in HPC teaching and training.
%\end{itemize}

\bigskip

\textbf{What can we contribute?}

There are various levels of contribution
\vspace*{-0.4em}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength\itemsep{-0.3em}
\item developing skill-tree scope and content
\item becoming ambassador for the program
\item steering of the governance body
\end{itemize}
\vspace*{-0.4em}

Simply visit our website \url{hpc-certification.org} and join the mailing lists!

\bigskip

\textbf{What does it cost to join?}

It is free to join for everyone!
However, for \textbf{full members} (with voting rights), we expect a minimum contribution to the overall program.
Note that anyone joining will be listed on the public webpage!

\medskip
\textbf{Meetings:}

A general assembly of members will occur at least twice a year -- during ISC and SC.
On a monthly basis, the program chair organizes a conference call, that shall be attended by the executive board but is open to members.

\medskip
\textbf{Providing teaching material:}

Since the certification program itself curates the curriculum but does not provide teaching material, anyone is welcome to provide teaching material -- we support branding of the material!

\headerbox{The PeCoH Project}{name=pecoh,column=2}{
	The Performance Conscious HPC (PeCoH) project* aimed to create a lightweight HPC certification program. During the first year, it became apparent to broaden the scope and form an independent governance entity to sustain the effort and gain acceptance. Project information:

\headerbox{Status}{name=next,column=2,below=pecoh}{

PeCoH contributed a concept paper, skill-tree, and a Javascript visualization to the effort.

Technically, skills are stored in an XML document and can be processed via XSLT into various representations; they are also available as Markdown.

The Javascripts can be re-used and configured by anyone -- e.g., for linking teaching material.

We established a set of rules with the members of the forum and voted for the members of the steering board.

\textbf{Responsibilities of the governance body}:

It is \textbf{not} its duty to interfere with content! We aim to preserve the teaching ecosystem.
